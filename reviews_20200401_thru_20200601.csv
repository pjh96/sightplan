Her primary complaint seems to be safety/criminal activity, so I would suggest that we focus our response there. Any feedback you may have for her, or insights on anything that has been done (or that you're planning to do) in response to these supposed issues, would be really helpful.

No safe place to drop packages in a common area. No access to building. Dial 955 to get office access at panel, then spend the next ten minutes hunting around with NO DIRECTIONAL SIGNAGE AT INTERSECTIONS to find a unit number. Unbelievably frustrating and I never want to have to come back here again!! update: Yeah, I hear your reply. I'm not joking about the lack of signage, though. In the big open courtyards, there's a number of 4-way intersections where there's absolutely no signage saying which is where - and not even a sign within reasonable distance of any direction. So you just have to walk, look for a number, look for another number, judge if it's going up or down, turn around, try a different intersection... that's what I mean about NO SIGNAGE. There are sparse signs at entryways, but that's about it. Within a courtyard of confusion, nothing. The same delivery guy isn't likely going to go to the same place twice. While I was delivering, every day is a new area, a new route. Can't expect delivery people to know - because almost every delivery is guaranteed to be their first (and last) time, just by how they get dispatched. Not to mention the inability to get around inside, with RFID locked doors every five feet, again having to find other ways around the locked doors, when the office is closed (either for C-19 or just outside business hours)...","https://www.google.com/search?q=Epic+600+Epic+Way+San+Jose+CA&ludocid=1990393792876847274#lrd=0x808fc9436dd97491:0x1b9f4c9beb9120aa,1",1,5/26/2020,"Hey there, Matt.

Nobody tried to cut it in 3 yrs that I'm living here. Playground near tennis courts are always dirty with birds feces. There are spiderwebs everywhere outside: stairs, buildings, playground structures. Pool is constantly closed for some renovations that never end. The only grill in the pool area is not available to me because of that. Pool parties on Sundays never supervised, people stay there till midnight sometimes and use glasses and bottles made of glass which is prohibited. Poll parties in the summer also always have more ppl than allowed by the rules. Sometimes residents invite families of 6-8 ppl as their guests to pool during summer time, especially on Sundays when management is out. There is an agressive dog (bull terier) in one of the units, they leave dog in the open garage with no leash and tiny fence with no supervision. This is potentially very dangerous situation. Leafe blowers produce a lot of noise and gas fumes. Why not switch to electric blowers?

Rents are soul-crushingly high everywhere in San Diego, might at as well live somewhere great! Location is 5/5, I'm 15 minutes from everything (except holidays going by fashion valley), and it's close enough to the water that it stays cooler over here in summer than all of my friends places. The apartments themselves are pretty decent, newly redone bathrooms and kitchens, the rest is ok. They are ok with paint/ decorating and I've really been able to make it my own. Inside courtyard location is great, I feel like I'm in a park, not on a busy street. Parking in my area is never an issue, and I appreciate the generously wide spots. The parking feels safe, there's lots of lighting and its good enough to keep Jaguars and Maseratis in so that's a good sign. There are brand new lighted carports available too. Electric/Plug in hybrid parking and charging provided. Leasing process was simple, so was signing my renewal. I haven't used the amenities much, but there's a beautiful heated pool, hot tub, tennis, gym, vending machine, small meeting room with wifi, dig runs, I think a putting green, and nice grills with seating and firepits. I don't have a dog, but there are dogs all over here, owners/landscapers are very good with cleanup up poop, I've never seen any. Landscaping in general seems a cut above. Lots of flowers that attract hummingbirds. Maintenance requests done online the night before are completed when I get home from work. Central air, individual washers and dryers in every unit.

We’ve had problems with them since the day we moved in. On move-in day we called them because there were bees swarming our apartment and they refused to do anything. Over the next few months we started experiencing spiders hanging from the tree in front of our front door. Eventually the spiders were building webs in front of our entrance and we were walking into spider webs daily and when we called to complain they laughed and advised us to carry a broom. After months of this we had to write them a letter and demand that they do something about the spiders. They then came out to our apartment with the current manager at the time and the maintenance supervisor to explain to us that the health of the tree that was over growing into our front door entrance was more important than the health of the residents who were paying rent. They refused to continue to cut back the tree that was blocking our front door they refused to continue to spray to keep the spiders from making webs in front of our door that was blocking our entrance. Ultimately, they refused to provide any assistance and we then had to contact the regional manager to see if they could help us with the situation. After about a week of communication with the regional manager he agreed to let us move into a different unit. The apartments then try to make us pay double rent for occupying apartments at the same time while we were trying to move which is physically impossible to move from one apartment to another without occupying them both. We then had to speak to two different managers from the regional office who finally did the right thing to let us move without being charged. These apartments are over priced, run down, and they are not worth the money or the headache that it causes to live here. The maintenance staff does a poor job of keeping the property, the laundry room constantly has transients in it, and the property itself is rundown, old, and falling apart. A couple weeks after we moved out we received a bill that was attempting to charge us an extra $100 over the deposit we had placed. besides the normal carpet cleaning and apartment cleaning fee; they were attempting to charge us $160 for painting the apartment that had no damage and we had only been there for eight months. When I called and spoke to someone in the office they became nasty and rude with me and hung up in my face. We had to reach out and email the manager and regional managers before this could be resolved. They ended up removing the bogus painting charge because they knew they were wrong. Their invoices are a joke they literally look like something typed up on someone’s computer that anyone could’ve created. This apartment was nothing but a headache from beginning to end and I can truly say I regret ever setting my sights on the Esplanade apartments. I strongly advise anyone who cares about being happy in their home to never rent from the Esplanade.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Esplanade+10201+Camino+Ruiz+San+Diego+CA&ludocid=328810805873514351#lrd=0x80dbf8c172412a83:0x4902baf9266976f,1",1,,"Kianna, we apologize for the challenges you encountered while you lived with us and understand frustrations about unforeseen move-out charges.

I lived here for a few years. Every time I move, even within the complex, they charge heavily on fixing the old apartment. Those fixing are unnecessary to common sense and non-logic. They charge you on repainting the wall even the wall has no stain, or replacing the carpet even the carpet has been professionally cleaned. The bill always come out to be around 500 dollars. It seems they just want to charge that 500 bucks for whatever reason. Watch out and reconsider if you want to move here.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Epic+600+Epic+Way+San+Jose+CA&ludocid=1990393792876847274#lrd=0x808fc9436dd97491:0x1b9f4c9beb9120aa,1",1,,"Greetings, Cao.

Inconvenienced myself and my family to add in a washer/dryer unit for downstairs for 3 weeks. Tore up our closet and our floor and had contractors entering into our apartment while both myself and infant son were sick with the flu at the time. - Towed multiple family members cars, even though there is a sticker system, which did not go on any of my family's cars. Fought to get refunds and only received half each time. - Lack of response on emails and returning phone calls, and sometimes just plain rudeness on the phone. Most recent example: Sent an email about moving out and scheduling a walkthrough on Friday April, 3rd. No response and no follow up, even after sending a second email on Sunday April, 5th. Called in, spoke to Nancy, and when I asked if they saw the email, her response was ""not sure, just tell me what the email said."" - Lastly, I have a whole email that I sent to customer care that I sent on July, 2017, listing out all of the complaints I had up until that time. It has been frustrating to live there to say the least, and I couldn't be any happier leaving. The community, the neighbors, amenities, and the apartment itself were great.

We’ve had problems with them since the day we moved in. Over the next few months we started experiencing spiders hanging from the tree in front of our front door. Eventually the spiders were building webs in front of our entrance and we were walking into spider webs daily and when we called to complain they laughed and advised us to carry a broom. Eventually we had to write them a letter and demand that they do something about the spiders. They then came out to our apartment with the current manager at the time and the maintenance supervisor to explain to us that the health of the tree that was over growing into our front door entrance was more important than the health of the residents who were paying rent. Ultimately, they refused to provide any assistance and we then had to contact the regional manager to see if they could help us with the situation. The apartments then tried to make us pay double rent for occupying apartments at the same time while we were trying to move which is physically impossible to move from one apartment to another without occupying them both. We then had to speak to two different managers from the regional office who finally did the right thing to let us move without being charged. These apartments are expensive, they are run down, and they are not worth the money or the headache that it causes to live here. A couple weeks after we moved out we received a bill that was attempting to charge us an extra $100 over the deposit we had placed. besides the normal carpet cleaning and apartment cleaning fee; they were attempting to charge us $160 for painting the apartment that had no damage and we had only been there for eight months. When I called and spoke to someone in the office they became nasty and rude with me and hung up in my face. We had to reach out and email the manager and regional managers before this could be resolved. They ended up removing the bogus painting charge because they knew they were wrong. Their invoices are a joke they literally look like something typed up on someone’s computer that anyone could’ve created. This apartment was nothing but a headache from beginning to end and I can truly say I regret ever setting my sights on the Esplanade apartments. I strongly advise anyone who cares about being happy in their home to never rent from the Esplanade.",https://www.apartments.com/esplanade-san-diego-ca/txnckwc/,0,,,,,,,,1

Leasing office good, maintenance good, but policing of troubled residence not so good. They might need to hire a security guard because parts of the complex sound like a university residence hall. Neighbors up until all hours of the morning blasting the radio, screaming, drunk. Call the front office and they slap a piece of paper on the neighbors door. It should be a crime to belt R Kelly through any wall so your neighbors can hear it. These walls are not that thin. It should be manslaughter when the neighbor tries to sing along. Neighbors walking through common areas with alcohol then this is the place. You want a pungent smell of cigarettes and marijuana coming through the screen with the breeze, this is your place. You want a random guy smoking a cigarette in the garage while leaning on your car, hurry call the leasing office. Not impressed with this place at all.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Regency+at+Encino+15506+Moorpark+St+Encino+CA&ludocid=6009445233036601223#lrd=0x80c297928a63d235:0x5365d6999c4fa787,1",1,,"We appreciated you bringing this concern to our attention, and we were glad to address it for you.

As a team, we want nothing more than to provide ample support to our residents, and we'll continue to assess areas where we can improve. We continue to be diligent about weeding out short-term rentals, and our package policy remains viable in that carriers will bring packages directly to your front door, though we do encourage people to arrange a time for delivery for when they are home. Also, we will address pests and irresponsible pet owners appropriately when notified. I hope this helps, but please feel free to contact me directly through a phone call, or send an email to us at avant@essex.com, so we can discuss on a more personal level.

They kept my deposit and charged me an additional 3300 for the carpet replacement. I refused to pay t because it wasn't my responsibility.

Luckily we had great neighbors, great experience with the maintenance team and also the leasing office, especially with Jill, she is amazing in answering all the questions and helping out with everything. All the maintenance requests were always closed timely, one of the major requests was that we had our washer and dryer replaced by new ones because the old ones were ripping the clothes. They were so quick in delivering the units, we were impressed. In general, the maintenance manager and his team do a great job in dealing with any kind of situations. Because of the lockdown as a result of Covid-19, we could not schedule a move-out inspection. Hopefully the move out costs will not be high, especially during these difficult times caused by the pandemic. Overall, we would recommend the complex to anyone moving in the area.

I lean over the railing to look at Amerige Avenue and the stretch of historical buildings, streets and lush green that make up the unique culture of Downtown Fullerton. Lately I find myself doing these more often while thinking, ""Man... I am going to miss living here."" Pinnacle at Fullerton is, by far, my #1 favorite place to live. That statement comes with an annotation that I had lived in Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York and in the desirable town of Edgewater, NJ along the Hudson River. Pinnacle at Fullerton offers combination of comfort, convenience and excellent customer service. Personally, I think the layout and design is absolutely gorgeous and well-thought out here - it makes you feel comfortable and cozy like it's your home and you're proud to call it home because everything here is so pleasant to look at. I never had an issue with noisy neighbor or pet remains lying around on the property. Pinnacle at Fullerton is located in the heart of Downtown Fullerton. There is countless number of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, hair salons, yoga studio, bookstore within walking distance. Not to mention museums, Fullerton train station and Fullerton College. Sprouts, Costco, Target, Walmart and Hwy 91 is just 5 minutes away, and getting on the Hwy 91 will take you to Hwy 5 and Hwy 57 in no time. The property is maintained meticulously by Tony and his team. Tony is always friendly and professional. I made 2 requests while living here, and both times Tony completed the work orders the same day I requested, with nothing but smiles and great attitude. Sara, the property manager, is very warm, empathetic and helpful - She always made me feel appreciated as her resident, even after I signed my lease and moved in. I know there are some managers who will look at you only as a dollar sign. Sara always went above and beyond with her service, and that's very rare these days. There is no such thing as perfect apartment community, but I truly believe Pinnacle at Fullerton comes very close to it. I am very sorry that I have to leave Pinnacle at Fullerton for work in another state. If I ever move back to Orange County, I'd definitely live at Pinnacle at Fullerton again.

Responsive to issues. Safety became a concern with the homeless and random people on 3rd/4th street. There were 2 separate occasions where someone tried to enter our apartment, and then pretended that they had the wrong address when they opened the door and they realised that we were home. But I appreciate the steps the management were taking to ramp up the security at the gates. I also found 2 homeless people sleeping by my car one morning. And then there is the homeless person that walks up and down the street yelling 'F**K' at 0500... non of which is the building's issue, but if I had to give negative feedback it would be related to the overall feeling of safety. But I would definitely recommend this building to a friend, despite these issues. It was modern, spacious. had assigned covered parking and in the heart of downtown, and was affordable.

We have to enable WiFi calling, and heaven forbid there’s an emergency between the exterior of the building and our front door, I would not be able to dial 911. Excessive dog barking on neighbors patio. They frequently leave the dog out there for extended periods of time. We’ve contacted office staff via phone and email and had mixed results. One email to the manager was never responded to. All amenities closed during pandemic is smart and appreciated, however I’m still paying the exact same rent which includes the benefit of those amenities. A temporary rent reduction would be appreciated. Garbage room on first floor near the garage entrance is gross. Other residents don’t bother to open the garbage bin, but instead throw garbage bags on top of garbage can or on the floor. Fire alarm frequently goes off and needs servicing and testing. Parking garage gate doesn’t fully open on one side so when two cars are coming and going it’s very tight. There’s plenty of things that we do appreciate and enjoy about the community, but these are the reasons we think about moving elsewhere.",/reviewBuilder/review/5e991cb93f903649daae3ede,1,,Thank you for bringing this to our attention and for taking the time to speak with us directly.

Yes, the landscaping is beautiful and the amenities are awesome but good luck getting your deposit back. Out of $600, we only received $74 back!

The have free parking outside the gate but good luck finding a spot! I contacted management so many times about vehicles being parked in the same spot for weeks or months and nothing was done. I've seen non-residents park their vehicles and then get into another car. We left that apartment in move in condition. The carpet was already matted to begin with, it only needed to be cleaned in the high traffic areas, touch up paint in some areas and replace one of slates of the blinds.

The staff at the leasing office is welcoming and understanding, even when I had to bring up an uncomfortable issue during the leasing process that ended up being just a small misunderstanding. Neither the office manager nor the office staff lost their professionalism and were able to explain the situation to us in a friendly way. Rachel helped us with our lease, paperwork, and all aspects of our moving experience. She demonstrated professionalism at its best, all the time. Rachel is a valuable asset for Essex and she is key to many of our excellent reviews! Rachel is very kind, understanding, and knowledgeable in her field. After living here for two months I can say it's a very quiet place, well taken care of, and they have an amazing custodial staff that takes almost no time in fixing anything that may be needed. Honestly, we have not found anything wrong with living here. Some of the inconveniences that the parking has, as mentioned by some of the reviews, is nothing compared with the quality of service and living in a nice and clean community. Although parking has never been an issue for us because we always find parking, we are so grateful we don't have to park outside a very busy street or unsafe neighborhood like the one where we moved from. Compared to the other side of the mountain, parking at Meadowood Apartments is heavenly! :) To put the icing on the cake, just this afternoon, I received a call from Christina asking how my husband and I were doing during these troubling times. I was surprised and grateful at the same time. No one, in any of the places I have lived before, had ever taken the time to call us and check in on us. Not even when we faced earthquakes! Thank you Meadowood Apartments, we are very happy tenants and we are grateful for the opportunity to live here.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Meadowood+1733+Cochran+St+Simi+Valley+CA&ludocid=10560158957385045813#lrd=0x80e829349ec88f11:0x928d389f22985735,1",1,,"Thanks for the two-month update, Ruth!

IMO, the only reason why this would be popular is because of its location. But it's not worth the location at all! It has one of the rudest and inconsiderate people at the resident services.

Every time we request anything to get fixed it takes a really long time to for anyone to respond. If they do respond 3 out of 4 appointments are no shows. We even had the office tell us that they didn’t have a key to get in and we were home the whole time. I’ve also noticed that the majority of our neighbors have parking spots fairly close to their apartments, however our parking is really far away which makes it a challenge for bringing in groceries and I don’t feel safe walking to and from my car in the dark by myself. Another major problem here is the noise. The design of having bedrooms below someone else’s uncarpeted living area was not carefully thought out. On top of that the neighbors above us are constantly building something all day and late into the night. We also have neighbors in another building that have parties late into the night with music and shouting. I’m very disappointed in the amount of money we pay and how we are treated as residents.

This place is absolutely terrific. The both the leasing staff and maintenance team are kind and attentive, especially the Community Manager Verita. We had a couple of paperwork bumps when we initially moved in but Verita personally stepped in and made every effort to ensure our move in was as smooth as possible and she has helped us with every need. Both the leasing team and maintenance are active seven days of the week; quite a welcome surprise for a relatively small community! The complex itself is not a gated community, but for all intents and purposes, it might as well be! Tucked into the hill, it is surrounded on two sides by greenery, the side facing Bothell-Everett Highway is completely fenced off, so the only access is from 164th. There's never any outside foot traffic and the local residents for the most part are quiet and friendly! They even have a contract with a security patrol company that sends a marked vehicle every so often to scope out the property, and though their appearance is welcome, I've never felt that they were necessary as I have never felt safer in a community! The rent is quite competitive for the area, though the pet fees are a bit high. There are amenities such as a basketball court, a pool, a small gym, a business centre, and a playground, though much of that is off limits amidst the current pandemic. There is somewhat sufficient open parking with carports (but no garages) available for rent at a reasonable fee. As far as I am aware, all units include washers and dryers (a big requirement for me), balconies, and fireplaces. When we moved in, the community was in the middle of unit renovations one by one with fresh paint, flooring, countertops, cabinets, and new appliances. At the time, we got to choose between a pre- and post- renovated unit with a small difference in rent rate, and the newly renovated units blew our expectations away. The community also recently received a fresh exterior paint job that looks terrific. Overall, we couldn't be happier to call this place home and hope to stay here for many more years to come. The location is terrific, the gated-property feel is exceptional, and the staff are fantastic to work with. A quiet, quaint community to call home.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Laurels+At+Mill+Creek+1110+164th+St+SE+Mill+Creek+WA&ludocid=10439897996469627671#lrd=0x549005e08257d15d:0x90e1f7ea32e26b17,1",1,,"Thank you for the kind review, Ripley.

Our rent has increased every year but there have been no updates, upgrades, or changes to our unit. There are so many issues with the condition of the apartment. The appliances and hardware look like they are all still the original outfitting from the 70s. Electrical outlets are loose &/or don’t have power. Refrigerator fan is broken and keeps freezing up and then leaking water, and we’ve had maintenance come and check it twice now, the second time we were told that there was nothing they could do short of replacing the whole fridge but that wouldn’t happen unless it stopped working altogether. So our options are either keep trying to capture the leaking condensation because the fan is not regulating properly, or wait until the fridge stops working altogether and our food spoils. Great. Furthermore, doors and cabinet doors are ajar because they are old af and won’t latch or stay closed. We’ve already had maintenance come and “address” this issue in the past too but it is still happening because the whole building structure is old and crumbling apart as is everything inside the units as well. The cheap ass laminated counter tops started cracking a year after we moved in, the same time the walls and the ceiling starting cracking apart after the rains and buildings settled. Oh yea, and the solution to that was to just fill the half inch structural crack in with caulk. Cool. When we put in a maintenance request to fix the countertops we were told that they would not be able to repair the cracked/chipped portion, only replace the whole thing, and to do that we would need to vacate the apartment for 48 hours, which is ridiculous because we don’t have another place to live in the meantime. So now we just live with a growing patch in the middle of the countertop like a bunch of crackheads. The icing on the proverbial cake was last month when there was a sewer line eruption in the flower bed right in front of our apartment entrance stairs, complete with turds and toilet paper floating down the sidewalk. Once they capped it off they just left the shit and TP to dry on the sidewalk and when we requested a cleanup we were told by the front office that it is technically the city’s job. What? You all just keep slapping bandaids on shit and then act like you’re so benevolent because you installed some new lights or applied a shitty ass paint job. Like wtf even was that? I’ve never seen a worse paint job in my life. You want to keep taking our money and expect us to keep paying even in the middle of a global pandemic but you give us no incentive to stay and keep paying more while the property continues to deteriorate and every time we ask for a an actual repair or solution all we get is excuses why it can’t be done or some half-ass coverup that just falls apart a few weeks or months later. So yea, I’d say our experience living here has been disappointing and frustrating to say the least. There have been domestic disturbances, bloody altercations, and disruptive neighbors that only worsens with each new move-in. We haven’t been able to use the pool or gym area in 2 years because it’s always overrun by shitty ass kids running around like a bunch of lawless animals &/or loud drunken parties. There’s constantly trash and litter defacing the property, not to mention the actual trash receptacle areas are always a disaster. And we had an infestation of roaches a couple months ago because our previous downstairs neighbors were disgusting slobs. I realize you can’t control everybody’s actions but it has become abundantly apparent that the quality of tenants that have moved in within the time we have lived here has declined significantly and that is a direct relation to the quality of ownership and management of the property itself.",/reviewBuilder/review/5ea4bae76fdf0701aa42b525,1,,"Hello Gwendolyn,

Our apartment has not been updated since we’ve moved in, still in the style of a 1970’s unit that probably hasn’t been updated since the complex was opened. Your neighbors also may have updates that your unit does not reflect, shouldn’t all the units be updated equally. My roommate have had to put in multiple maintenance problems, but they just paint over the problem, and then we continue to the problem as our unit was not updated before we moved in. We have been here 3 years. Last time it rained the streets were literally flooded with toilet paper and shit. We were again told this was not the complex responsibility, and nothing was done to assist with shit and toilet paper flooding the streets, can’t believe they have raised our rent 3 times since we’ve been here, but do nothing to address our concerns. We are always met with an excuse. Ohh there aren’t enough workers to complete the request.. no there are workers they are just on Facebook in the leasing center. Not my problem when we pay $2,000 to live here.

While we were certainly disappointed to read your comments, we appreciate you sharing your concerns with us. Typically, we would reach out directly to discuss these issues and learn how to best assist, but we unfortunately don't have a record of anyone by your name as a leaseholder with us. I would welcome the opportunity to chat further, and I urge you to reach out at your convenience and ask for me personally. Regarding unauthorized persons within our property, we ask that residents report any such situations immediately. In the case of this specific individual, our team escorted him from the community and we have involved law enforcement, as well. Also, we're always glad to address any conditions that may develop, as well as violations of our community policies, so please don't hesitate to reach out if our assistance is ever needed. Depending on the situation, much of our response may take place behind the scenes, though please know that we do follow up on all resident complaints. We would appreciate the opportunity to improve your experience, and if there is anything else we can do for you I hope you'll let me know. -- Liz S., Catalina Gardens.",,"Approved. Thank you.

I have lived here with my husband for 2 years now, and it was our first apartment after we got married. Boy are we spoiled to have gotten to live in Carmel Landing as our first spot. YES the parking is tight, but the office will work with you to try and find a new spot, or offer an alternate solution. Itza, Wendy, Louise, and Zack have all been incredibly helpful over the years, and sometimes I just pop into the office to say hello and see another smiling face. The community is overall very clean, quiet, and respectful. Maintenance is responsive, and kind. The gyms and facilities are truly a great extension of your space when you live in a smaller apartment. The rent didn't increase very much from year to year and this location allowed us to explore so many parks, local restaurants, and new areas. For us it was more than just a house, it truly became our little home, where we had neighbors over for wine, talked with all the community staff and maintenance workers, and truly enjoyed feeling like part of a community. We're sad to be leaving soon, but thankful for all the positive experiences we've had here. My advice for people apartment shopping is to remember who typically writes reviews. A lot of people will quickly write about one or two bad experiences, or will leave a review if they were ""blown away"", but often the ""content"" don't leave as many reviews. This community has less stars than it deserves, and if you have lingering questions ask the front office- they are very transparent.

The stay at the house was not very pleasant due to the following reasons. 1) Many service requests were not resolved promptly. 2) The free parking assigned to me was far from the house I was staying. 3) The house was not clean when I moved in and my child fell ill. The only spot painting was done by Essex when I moved in. But, when I moved out you deducted a big amount towards cleaning , painting. 4) The house doesn't get any sun light and it is poorly ventilated. 5) The appliances were not new when I moved in. The cook top was already having scratches and white spots when I moved in. But, I was charged to pay for replacing the stove top. 6) There are very less number of visitors parking. Thanks & Regards, Paresh",/reviewBuilder/review/5eae3ad177ec1d1016485f92,2,," Thanks for your response. They just refunded $80.00 house cleaning charge.   The  have charged $260.00 for stove top replacements because  it has some white spots. When I moved in to the apartment the stove top was having  some of the white marks  and   some burned food stains. I think the old photo that they have sent me on the email didn't capture the white spots as the photo was taken from the wrong angle.   The $260 charged for replacing the stove top is inappropriate as the stove top is meant to be used daily.  

Please refund this amount.

Moving out had been a completely different story. First they did my move out inspection on not the day promised. They entered with no notice. Left a laundry list of things that needed fixing. When I asked about it everyone claimed to know nothing and none of my questions were ever answered. They never sent an itemized list of repairs they made after I moved out . They claimed to have sent it to my emergency contact address where nothing ever showed up. I called to find out what was up and again they gave me a fake answer and told me they would email it to me. They never emailed it and are trying to charge me utilities for all of April when I moved out the 2nd.

From conferring with Hillsdale Garden, the team previously sent a final statement your way and asks that you reach out if you haven't received it or wish to talk through any charges. For context, we can tell you that utility bills run two months behind, so a bill in April would reflect February charges.

We understand your frustration over the recent fire alarms, and we're working to educate all residents to help prevent similar incidents moving forward. The recent alarms were the result of residents venting their cooking smoke into the common hallways, which triggered our main alarm. Our alarm system is working properly, but we are checking to ensure that the sensitivity is set correctly. With more people working from home and children home from school, we do expect more daytime noise at our community. However, we are still seriously about enforcing our noise policies and after-hours rules, and we encourage residents to report disturbances. Please know that most of our efforts to address such situations take place behind the scenes, but we do follow up on every complaint that we receive. If you have questions, or if there is anything else we can do for you, I hope you'll let us know. Thank you. -- Lisa A., Santa Palmia.",,"SOUNDS GOOD

I didn't like the corporate feel of rent negotiations, and how we were unable to send packages to the office for pickup. That's the whole point of an office during a gated community. Also, the hallways were constantly dirty despite monthly cleanings. For the money that is paid, I would imagine bi-weekly cleanings are probably in the best interest. Also, there was a downstairs neighbor that used narcotics heavily and would be loud at all hours of the night. Upon report of this, Nancy with the front office informed the person that it was me who was complaining about the noise, and he subsequently confronted me. I diffused what could have been a potentially hostile situation. We subsequently left the apartment after fearing for our safety.",/reviewBuilder/review/5eb43278cdcc8c2ce2f8a95c,1,,"Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback, Tim.

Me and my wife moved out earlier this year because we didn't want to deal with the rude management team. Kisaol Kilmer ,Marshall Lewis and Sydney Saenz are terrible. Kisaol K has no interest in the job and doesn't do anything. She is the very worst of the worst of all managers any business could have and creates more problems than is worth having a manager.She has no interpersonal skills and is clueless about management and doesn't have any skills to work in the residential rental property business. It seems no one checked her previous work experience in Mercer Island or references before hiring her. Me and my wife are trying to report something and Kisaol and Marshall were laughing at us, so passive aggressive. The only time Marshall even pretends to work be cordial and professional is when he is on a tour with a new tenant.If you can't find him in the leasing office during office hours just go to the local grocery store he is probably out shopping.so many times we have seen him out during working hours when is supposed to be taking care of issues that tenants have. We wondered how many days does Belcarra give him off in week. Sydney doesn't seem to have any work experience and can't answer even simple questions or help with anything. The maintenance team is very good and do all the work for the tenants and run the show. Everything is online and management doesn't even receive packages. Our feedback to Essex board who owns this Belcarra property is this please move everything one hundred percent online totally. This management team with Kisaol K, Marshall L , Sydney S is redundant unnecessary waste of space and you are wasting money paying for an already nonexistent nonfunctioning management that is causing more confusion and harm than any good. Keep the maintenance guys and hire one new person who has the interest and skills to do tours with new tenants and hand over the keys when they move in. To future tenants please take your money and run as fast and far as you can as long as Kisaol Marshall and Sydney are on the management team.you will be wasting your life, time and money with these people.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Belcarra+10688+NE+10th+St+Bellevue+WA&ludocid=18002905893559609646#lrd=0x54906c8eecb05949:0xf9d72b86d668292e,1",0,,,,** This has been flagged by Essex and LTM.,5/19/2020,Paul Willis,,0

She complains about the cleanliness of the community, but let me know if you have any idea what might have set her off. Thanks -- Paul W.",5/12/2020,Paul Willis,,1

Our community does utilize a backup generator, which was activated immediately to restore emergency systems. As soon as we were able to access our email system, we delivered a message to our resident notifying them of the power outage and linking them to PGE for updates. We also had team members walking the lobbies to assist residents, answer any questions, and our team had water available for residents.

The amenities here are mediocre and though the views of the roof are good. When I left management was a pain to deal with (probably all Essex properties) and I hear it's gotten worse from someone who lives there now with them shutting down office service. There is an issue during the summer with the front door being covered in flies that's still an issue when I was there recently. When it gets warm out, the garbage from below would make the stairwells smell pretty rank. I was told this was fixed but not sure. Maintenance staff were good and moderately responsive. Anyhow, the price is good for the location if you're into parties or food in capital hill but between the management and the flies, not a huge fan of this place. Solid two stars, might be a three if I had a better impression of their management.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Vox+Apartments+1527+15th+Ave+Seattle+WA&ludocid=52847523325004479#lrd=0x54906ad20595e445:0xbbc08adf0bcabf,1",1,,"It's good to hear from you again, Sam, and we appreciated your time as a resident.

Essex is a publicly traded company whose shares trade over $240. They own 245 apartment communities in California and Washington. Too many people inside my community don’t wear masks to get their mail where they often congregate. The paths are four feet wide. It is impossible to physical distance.... When I asked the community manager to post a few awareness signs around the community, nothing was done. In fact, she called me to tell me that nothing would be done. Many other signs have been posted “don’t feed stay cats, YOU WIILL BE CHAGED!!!” “If you are seen dropping trash on the ground you WILL BE CHARGED!!!

If you are looking for a fancy resort-like complex, then this is not a place for you. For a relatively lower rent, you get a good size unit with some patio space, a garage space, and a decent size pool and workout room. The management team has been very responsive every time I had an issue, and the maintenance person is super friendly and he fixed any issues with my apartment very smoothly. I have a separate AC/Heating unit for bedroom and the livingroom which has been helpful in saving costs. Considering the high rent in the area, I think the Fountains at River Oaks offers a great value. It's close to highways, shopping areas, and it's very quiet here.

Alfonso who runs maintenance for the entire complex is stellar. Most of the neighbors we'd encountered are friendly. Now the negatives, of which there are many. This property was once managed by another management company before it was taken over by Essex. Every single resident we have talked to over the 15 months we were there liked the previous management company better. That speaks volumes. If you're spending $3000 - $4000+ per month, you should expect more from a property such as this. With 3 young kids, the number one priority for us was to be in a well-insulated building. I worried about my children making noise for others. I was told repeatedly that noise wasn't an issue, everything was well-insulated, and they almost never get any complaints. This is demonstrably false, not just for me but also for other tenants who told me their stories. I trusted the leasing office, but then day 3 after moving in, we had security called on us. In short, the complaint was from an egocentric neighbor below us who never showed his face or even made an effort to have a cordial conversation in the 15 months we were there. What were our kids doing? Laughing and playing hide-and-seek. Not bouncing a ball. I tried to take the high road and wrote an apology to the tenant, who clearly conflated contrition with obsequiousness. Over the months, he repeatedly scared our kids (who started referring to him as ""the angry man"") by constantly banging loudly on the ceiling, even when he heard noise from neighboring apartments and not ours. The leasing office never apologized for misleading us as they were clearly concerned with was filling empty vacancies. More proof? The communal fireplaces, used as a selling point and told to me during the tour that they are to be repaired soon, never worked. In fact, they haven't worked for years according to some. The excuse from the leasing office? As soon as they got reports, they started taking bids and then had to shut the project down due to Covid-19. Clearly, the timetable does not back up this claim. Months earlier, they had no issue hiring people to redo landscaping out front and painting concrete into white and black squares to match tile by the door. Naturally, curb appeal to attract new tenants took priority over the concerns of existing tenants. More proof? The pool table had a rip in it...never addressed or repaired. Gym equipment? The grips on the universal were coming off, and the rubber was never replaced, just trimmed off. Swiss ball popped one day? Never replaced. Flooding that occurs inside the stairwell on the first floor by the dog run after a rain? Never remedied. How about VOMIT? One day, someone vomited in one of the elevators. We told someone in the leasing office face-to-face late morning/early afternoon that Saturday. He said they got several calls about it and will address it right away. Vomit stayed there until late Monday morning. Can you imagine the stink it left for nearly 48 hours? I understand that no one is on site except for emergencies on Sunday, but clearly if the lone cleaning person is unable to tend to the mess that Saturday, someone in the leasing office should have. I've had my share of dirty jobs. Leaving that mess there on the floor was unacceptable by any health standards. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I haven't even addressed other safety issues like elevator doors that either won't close (only flinch) or elevators that jerk suddenly up and down right when you get in (at random). Again, never addressed or remedied. How about electronic keypad locks that were installed on every door to make it easier for maintenance to enter units? Safety hazard: try telling someone chasing you down the hall to please wait while you enter a complicated 6-digit code and a check mark before you can go inside. The garage gate also consistently failed and stayed open for days on end at times. I can't speak for all Essex-managed properties, but I can definitely say that you should avoid Emerson Valley Village at all costs.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Emerson+Valley+Village+12000+Riverside+Dr+Valley+Village+CA&ludocid=11630475949381021236#lrd=0x80c29600b78e0b91:0xa167c0414b946e34,1",1,,"We're sorry about the challenges you've encountered, Michael, though we always appreciate it when residents take the time to share their concerns with us.

It's quiet for the most part and clean. I haven't seen any signs of vandalism or theft in the year I've been here. People are comfortable having packages delivered to their door without the thought of someone stealing them, if that says anything. Apartments do get warm quickly, and the AC unit doesn't circulate too well, so I do encourage you to bring a portable fan for the bedrooms. Animal friendly. Parking I'll give a 9/10 because the office is very accomodating. Rent pricing is very reasonable.",https://www.apartments.com/village-green-la-habra-ca/svqgt56/,0,,,,,,,,

I didnt hear back for over a week or so. So i had to call in and make an appointment. After a few days, we got a separate email asking when we would like come over. So confusing. 2) we went for a tour, and we liked the apartment so signed the paper to lock in an unit. We asked multiple times to make sure there will be no delay in the move-in date and the sales representative said there won’t be. After 3 weeks, they pushed the move-in date by one month. We still took the risk and decided to trust them. After 6 weeks, they pushed out the move-in date by 2 months again. 3) We went into month to month plan at the current apartment and paid additional rent while waiting for Mylo to complete construction which Mylo said they would compensate for up to $500. But it was a lie and they said they can’t compensate since we didnt end up choosing Mylo because of their delays. 4) they said they could refund the application fee and the check was sent out to us. It never came. We patiently waited for 3 weeks and followed up. The response we got was the check was cashed out despite it never arriving and they needed proof that we paid for the application fees. IS THIS A JOKE? How much more of our time are you trying to waste? If we didnt pay the fees, we would have never locked in an unit in the first place. What really upsets me though is they would not apologize for any of this until I say I am not happy. No sense of customer service. These people are totally incompetent and going to waste your time.

There is more too. I had to stay home from work 4 times to be there when repairs were made, I had to have the same thing looked at more than once, the shower tile was coated with some sort of paint that peeled off and unveiled black mold on the grout underneath, and the tub had to be caulking 2 times.

We take pest concerns very seriously, and we appreciate your cooperation in getting the termite issue resolved, though it can sometimes require multiple treatments. Your frustration over the alarms is certainly understandable, though our alarm system has been tested and is working property. In addition to cooking smoke, we've had some instances where someone smoking near a sensor has triggered the alarms, and we suspect that's what was responsible for the instances late at night. We apologize for any noise issues related to our roofing project. As we discussed, this was necessary for preventative reasons, and fortunately the noise issues should subside after the first week. Please let us know if you have additional questions. As you noted, last year's earthquake caused the historic tunnel at our dog park to collapse. We anticipate the repairs will be made this year, though we've unfortunately been waiting on permits and approvals from the city. We look forward to being able to bring all of our amenities back online. John and Fernando will definitely appreciate the kind words, and I know they have been happy to lend a hand.

I have been in my unit for 14 years. I had been taping them for the past year or so to keep them up. Because they were old. I had put in a request stating that the blinds keep falling and I had removed them because it became too much work and looked bad. They are old! When Sergio came to my apartment he states that because I have 2 panels in my window the blinds were falling. This is not the case. The 2 narrow panels are for decoration and would not affect the blinds being opened and closed ( which I have kept) I stated in 2 emails to him that I have no privacy and a single woman living alone needed this resolved and I would even pay out of pocket. I received no response to any follow up emails from him..

We lived in Carmel Landing for 13 months, the #1 complaint we have is the parking. Such a tight squeeze and nothing is ever done when cars are double-parked. Second, We have almost never had a good experience with the leasing office. When moving out I called and asked what we needed for moving out if we needed to fill out any paperwork & I was told no. We just needed to do a pre-move out inspection so I went ahead and booked it. 1 week later I get a call saying we need to book our pre-move out inspection, I told her we already scheduled and she said it wasn’t on the calendar, so we re-booked. Days later I was called again asking from a THIRD employee at the leasing office for our “move out” documents. But we were told we didn’t need to sign any documents. When I received the documents the date was saying we would move out 2021 instead of 2020. It was fixed and we signed. Days later, we were told it was done incorrectly on their end and we needed to re-sign. Over and over again there was issues. After moving out and talking to three different employees I still received phone calls asking for our forwarding address that I have given 4 times now. All said & done, we put in a $1,000 security deposit (pet deposit) and only received back $100...

I very much enjoy my stay here. This place accommodates my every need for my family and my dogs. I am a first responder as well and the office crew was very helpful in accommodating my needs when I was away fighting fire. At the time I lived alone at apex with two dogs and I needed my dog sitter to have access to the complex to take them out while I was away. The office crew was absolutely amazing. With a letter of proof the office personnel was able to give me an extra fob free of charge. I especially appreciate the time and care the entire maintenance crew takes in my apartment needs. I know I have seen some employees here come and go. So yes, there are new faces. However, the maintenance crew stays consistent with the same friendly faces that us renters can be comfortable with. And we do appreciate that. The first time Maintenance technician Eddie Estrada came by my unit for a work order he was very kind and open minded. My dogs can some times make people turn the other way. However, this was not the case for Eddie when meeting my family dogs. He was open to letting me introduce him to my fur babies and even feed them treats. One time I asked Eddie if he minded if I could leave the dogs out while he did a work order so I can do some training with them. He didn't mind at all.

Coming from NY state and moving across the country, I really had no clue where was a good area to live in LA. I wanted to be in a place where I could easily meet new people and also have shopping and culture at my doorstep. I came across Bunker Hill Towers Apartments by chance, and I am so happy with my decision to become a resident. DTLA has areas which are unsafe and sketchy, but Bunker Hill Tower Apts and it’s immediate surrounding area is safe and well monitored by security day and night. There is an enormous courtyard within the complex which is mostly separate from the craziness of the street; I have a small dog, and myself, like many other tenants, are able to walk our 4-legged friends at any time of the day. I rented a 1 bedroom, which offered a decent amount of space for inner-city living; it is modern and bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows. Other big perks about the complex are that there is a trusted dog-walker who resides at the complex who came recommended to me, and there is a fabulous corner store/market behind the complex. I enjoyed living here so much that I signed a new lease and upgraded to a 2 bedroom corner apt, which is just as beautiful as the pictures on the website. The leasing office and always accommodating and Monica and Natalie have really gone out of their way to make sure I have been satisfied. DTLA living isn’t necessarily cheap, but Bunker Hill Towers Apartments is definitely worth checking out, even if you are only able to afford leasing for a short-time. Also good to know, is that the complex is rent-controlled... if you are looking to reside in the DTLA area for a longer period of time.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Bunker+Hill+Towers+234+S+Figueroa+St+Los+Angeles+CA&ludocid=8108874449806278891#lrd=0x80c2c7ad5ceedad5:0x7088825974f1c0eb,1",1,,"We know moving from out of state can be intimidating, Virginia, especially to a place like LA.

We appreciate your time here and apologize for any challenges you encountered during your stay. Our team aims to handle resident requests expeditiously, and we regret if you experienced otherwise.

Our team offered additional available units, but we understand that you preferred the original. With regard to any paperwork delays on your transfer to our sister community of Reveal, please note that the transfer process takes about 72 hours. We apologize if anything was unclear on our end during that process. Again, we sincerely thank you for your decision to live with us and wish you the best moving forward. -- Kal S., Avondale at Warner Center.",,"Hi,
Please remove” the process begins once the transferring residents pays the transfer fee”, I do not want to give the resident the impression that we do not trust they will pay the fee especially if they are staying with Essex. Just add the transfer process takes about 72 hours.

Only suggestions on any improvements would be to invest in security cameras at all entrance to buildings and hallways. This will avoid stollen packages, illegal tenants coming and going, vandalism to building walls, door locks and alarms being pulled for pranks. Parking to be improved by not towing vehicles due to lack of parking for residents and guest parking. Warning of violation tickets to be put on vehicles vs immediate tow. Residents should get a parking spot with all vehicles and not have to pay extra for a second vehicle. Large signs should be in parking lot as RESIDENT PARKING ONLY to warn all visitors along with TOWING rules, parking hours and regulations. SMOKING should be 30 feet away from buildings. This avoids the foul smell at doorway entrance and smoking into resident’s windows. I thank the hard working maintenance crew and office staff for all their hard work and amazing personality.

We're sorry for the issues you noted, and our team urges our residents to reach out to either our office or after-hours courtesy patrol service if they encounter a situation that requires immediate attention. Our community observes quiet hours from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m., and our courtesy patrol service is quick to resolve any reported violations. We replaced all hallway carpets last year and also repainted all interior hallways and building exteriors last year. While we clean regularly and strive to keep those areas fresh, we ask that residents alert us to any conditions that may develop. Though our alarm system is working properly, the alarms do occasionally sound and in non-emergency cases we always follow up with communication to our residents to help prevent such incidents. All of our amenities are currently closed in compliance with Covid-19 health guidelines, though we look forward to reopening all of our facilities, including the state of the art fitness center that debuted last year. If you have any questions, we hope you'll contact our office directly. Thank you. -- Stephanie P., 5600 Wilshire.",,"Approved

Not only that, but every time I call to follow up on this issue no one seems to even understand or remember what my problem is. I understand we are in a pandemic, but experiencing a completely broken AC system in a home when it's 100+ degrees outside is in breach of the warranty of habitability clause. I have offered to get the air conditioner fixed myself, but have been told I cannot. This is getting absolutely ridiculous. I pay an insane amount of money to live in a place that doesn't have working appliances. Additionally, there are constant package issues with this apartment. They get lost nonstop, are left in front of the leasing office for no apparent reason, and are locked in random post boxes with a seemingly missing key to retrieve them. The walls and floors are paper thin (I can literally hear my upstairs neighbors walking lightly from room to room). And the fire alarms have gone off at least 6 times in the last month for no reason. My cat is now terrified of the TV making noises because she thinks it's an alarm. The one thing I will say is that Rosey in the leasing office is incredibly kind and helpful. I unfortunately haven't been able to work with her through this insane air conditioning issue, but I did really appreciate her help and guidance during the move in process. She's the one saving grace to this place. All in all, I highly recommend you continue your apartment search and skip this place. Unless you want to be sweating nonstop, constantly kicked out of your apt due to alarms, and spend a good chunk of the day listening to your neighbors conversations against your will.",https://www.apartments.com/epic-san-jose-ca/l8r08lg/,0,,,,,,,,1

Nothing has been done about the late night to 2 am game play and banging that is going in above my roommate Pats room. Nothing was said about the teenage terrorist trying to break into his bedroom window at 3 AM a couple of weeks ago while his parents were away AGAIN!, all of this is just thrown under the rug, life as usual, a little quiet for a couple of weeks and then boom it happens all over again. With the crap that the teenage terrorist has pulled especially lately you would think that he would have no privileges but right now he's hanging out with others in his room making noise. We have been extremely patient especially with respect to the special needs child but he stomps back and forth and it's just 'Oh well, no big deal' nobody takes him outside to run, 4 family members just sit there and think ( or don't) no big deal, but with all that we have had to put up with, the teenage terrorist playing his music loud, smoking pot with his buddies with the window open, stomping around and having a party while the adults are away, or the late night, early morning video game playing and banging this just adds to it. This continues upstairs and the people who are responsible and have been for two excruciating years just go on as if nothing is wrong, no big deal, we have already had retaliation from them so it needs to be addressed, period! Now how about that parking! the parking has got worse ever since the parking revenue scam took effect and people that I talk to are pissed, it has never been this bad and i have been here for almost 7 years, I see numerous garages in my building that have furniture in them and these same people park in front of their garages, let me see, isn't there a rule in the lease agreement that says do not park in Red Zones or in front of your garage? sure is! but I see it everyday and our so called Patrol One or whatever is the latest service do not do a damn thing, this is a safety violation but Oh well! Why do I as well as many other tenants have to pay for parking when all we have to do is park in front of our garage or red zone?, I could save myself $30 , there is no parking because garage and parking rules are not enforced. I said this to the regional manager when they implemented this scam a year ago and he blew it off, it happened just like I said, people who live by the lease agreement will pay more and those that constantly try and get away with things will get rewarded, why pay $30 for a parking spot when like my next door neighbor you can park in front of it with no repercussions, or how about I save $800 by using my garage as a storage unit instead and only $ for a parking spot, such a deal! I'll take that any day. Now on to how trashy the property looks, yeah! the stairwells are loaded with trash, the walkways are dirty with stains, the trash area's are always full and there is trash in the bushes, I hear the Section 8 housing across the street is cleaner, sad! We pay almost $3000.00 to live in a place where the neighbors above get away with terrorism, other neighbors put tenants at risk because they park in red zones that are reserved for Emergency vehicles and the ones that are basically forced into paying for a parking spot so when they come home they will have some sort of peace of mind that they have a place to park, by the way I have already had two people park in my spot during business hours and had no help from the fleecing office, even though I have a piece of paper that states "" Please check with the office so that we may try and contact the person in your spot before you tow"" I found the the ones parking in my spot, all I got was back talk from the office. You have put people with paid parking spots in a bad position. These concerns need too be addressed, I have talked to many of my good neighbors and have l lost many because they feel the same way as I do.",/reviewBuilder/review/5ed19c32634c414deecae067,0,,,,,,,mattmitchell88@live.com,0

Epic has informed me they're going to work on their maintenance/resident communication which is good. Hoping it improves in the future! Both of my air conditioning units have been broken for over a month now and despite several (we're talking 10+) phone calls back and forth to maintenance and leasing, nothing has been done to fix them. Not only that, but every time I call to follow up on this issue no one seems to even understand or remember what my problem is. I understand we are in a pandemic, but experiencing a completely broken AC system in a home when it's 100+ degrees outside is in breach of the warranty of habitability clause. I have offered to get the air conditioner fixed myself, but have been told I cannot. This is getting absolutely ridiculous. I pay an insane amount of money to live in a place that doesn't have working appliances. Additionally, there are constant package issues with this apartment. They get lost nonstop, are left in front of the leasing office for no apparent reason, and are locked in random post boxes with a seemingly missing key to retrieve them. The walls and floors are paper thin (I can literally hear my upstairs neighbors walking lightly from room to room). And the fire alarms have gone off at least 6 times in the last month for no reason. My cat is now terrified of the TV making noises because she thinks it's an alarm. The one thing I will say is that Rosey in the leasing office is incredibly kind and helpful. I unfortunately haven't been able to work with her through this insane air conditioning issue, but I did really appreciate her help and guidance during the move in process. She's the one saving grace to this place. All in all, I highly recommend you continue your apartment search and skip this place. Unless you want to be sweating nonstop, constantly kicked out of your apt due to alarms, and spend a good chunk of the day listening to your neighbors conversations against your will.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Epic+600+Epic+Way+San+Jose+CA&ludocid=1990393792876847274#lrd=0x808fc9436dd97491:0x1b9f4c9beb9120aa,1",1,,"We apologize for the delay in fixing your A/C unit, Keelin.

We got our unit 300 bucks below the above price range and with promotional terms, a free month of rent! I can barely hear our neighbors when they are playing music.
